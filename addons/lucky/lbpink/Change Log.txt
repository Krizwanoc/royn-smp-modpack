Notes:
As of this update every wishing well from the 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 series are ack.
This update has the second biggest change log, only being beaten by Lucky Block Pink 8.0 [Re:Start].
First update since Lucky Block Pink 6.9.1 [The Magic Update] which released October 8th, 2021 to release in October.
The new texture is a recolouring with some added detail of the original 1.7.10/1.8.2 lucky block pink with hearts texture.
First update since Lucky Block Pink 6.9.1 [The Magic Update] which released October 8th, 2021 to have the name of "The [Word] Update."
The next update, Lucky Block Pink 8.3 will be focusing on finally updating the Pink Love Potion, Pink Lucky Sword, and Pink Lucky Bow.
This is the first update since Lucky Block Pink 2.6 which released August 9th 2015 in which lucky block pink has had an animated texture.
Lucky Block Pink is now mildly OP as I felt like it fit better to the nature of lucky blocks, its still mostly balanced, but fits in better with the regular lucky blocks.
This update has introduced the most structures into Lucky Block Pink ever beating Lucky Block Pink 6.4 [The Restructure Update] which released February, 29th, 2020 and introduced 16 structures.
My main goals for this update was to make lucky block pink's drops better overall, a return to form, focusing on more quality drops + better rewards for good drops and combining several of the bad drops to make them drop less likely.
This update of Lucky Block Pink reintroduces a lot of drops/simulates drops from before Lucky Block Pink 3.0 which released on November 22nd, 2015 (and a few drops released after, but to a lesser degree) hence the name of the update being, "The Classic Update".
This update released exactly 6 years after NEO Lucky Block Pink [1.7.10] and Lucky Block Pink 5.3.1 [The Massive Update Pt. 2] both of which released October 7th, 2017 and also marking first time ever on a non-Feb 12th day two updates have released on the same day.
